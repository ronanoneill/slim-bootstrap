# slim-bootstrap

Timesaver when spinning up new bespoke PHP sites.

High level PHP web framework based off of the [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) (installed using the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) dependency manager) incororating [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating. Currently includes some very basic MySQL (PDO) and MongoDB Clients. Solr, ElasticSearch and Redis clients coming soon, along with Handlebars support.
